Green Sales is an app to manage sales! Once on the site, the user is able to register clients with initial credit or initial debt. It is possible to register a sale to an existing customer, the value of which will update debt or credit values in the customer's account.

Green Sales was developed using [React JS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) and consumes data from a custom API created using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). Besides React and Firebase, other technologies were employed, such as: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) and more.

## Features

### **Dashboard Page with recent sales and analytical data**

The dashboard page presents a plot depicting sales made during the day, that was implemented using the Recharts library.

### **Client Register Page**

"TextField" input components, from the Material UI library, were used on the client registration page. In addition to form validation, the data also undergoes a content validation before being submitted.

### **Client List Page**
